Robotic Lawn Mower description 
A grass-cutting robot, also known as a lawn mower robot, is a robotic device designed to automatically cut and maintain a lawn. These robots use sensors and algorithms to navigate and mow the lawn and can be programmed to cut the grass on a specific schedule or in response to the growth rate of the grass. Some grass-cutting robots are also equipped with features such as obstacle detection, anti-theft protection, and remote control via a smartphone app.
